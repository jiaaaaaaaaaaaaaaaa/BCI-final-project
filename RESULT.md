In this research, we compared the five highest error rate participants’ alpha waves in Fp1 and Fp2 and the theta waves in Fz and Pz to the five lowest error rate participants’ alpha waves in Fp1 and Fp2 and the theta waves in Fz and Pz. We used the independent samples t-test. The result showed that the independent t-test for alpha waves in Fp1 and Fp2 between participants with high and low error rates was not significant, t(8) = 0.97，p = .36. The independent t-test for theta waves in Fz and Pz was also not significant, t(8) = 1.60，p = .15 (see figure 1). Besides, the mean alpha waves in Fp1 and Fp2 of five lowest error rates participants was 2.37; the theta waves in Fz and Pz of five lowest error rates participants was 1.98. The mean alpha waves in Fp1 and Fp2 of five highest error rates participants was 3.78; the theta waves in Fz and Pz of five highest error rates participants was 1.63 (see figure 2).

Although the present study didn't reveal significant differences in alpha and theta brain wave activities between participants with high and low error rates, a trend was observed: participants with lower error rates exhibited higher power in both the alpha and theta frequency bands. While not statistically significant, this pattern may reflect more stable attentional control and lower cognitive load during the task. This finding is consistent with previous research suggesting that alpha and theta activity may serve as neural indicators of attention quality.
